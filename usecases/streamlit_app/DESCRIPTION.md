## Description of `app.py` and `ingest.py`

### `app.py`

The `app.py` file contains the main application logic for Streamlit that allows users to upload files (such as CSV, PDF, DOC, or DOCX) and ask questions related to the content of those files. Here's an overview of its functionality:

1. **Imports:** The file starts with importing necessary libraries, including `streamlit` for building the web interface and `subprocess` and `sys` for handling library installation.

2. **User Input:** If the `streamlit` library is not installed, the script prompts the user to install it. Otherwise, it imports the library.

3. **File Upload and Question Input:** The user can input their Google API Key, choose a file type, upload a file, and enter a question related to the uploaded file.

4. **Retriever Initialization:** Depending on the chosen vector database type (`Chroma` or `Pinecone`), the appropriate retriever is initialized to extract relevant information from the uploaded file.

5. **LLM Initialization:** The GeminiModel is initialized to generate responses based on the uploaded file's content and the user's question.

6. **Response Generation:** Using the initialized retriever and LLM, the script generates a response to the user's question based on the uploaded file's content.

7. **Display Response:** The generated response is displayed to the user.

### `ingest.py`

The `ingest.py` file contains functions related to data ingestion and retriever initialization. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

1. **Imports:** The file imports necessary modules from the `beyondllm` package and the `os` module.

2. **`get_retriever` Function:** This function takes various parameters such as the uploaded file, Google API Key, vector database type, and Pinecone configuration options. It processes the uploaded file, initializes the appropriate retriever (either Chroma or Pinecone), and returns the retriever object.

3. **Vector Database Initialization:** Depending on the chosen vector database type (`Chroma` or `Pinecone`), the function initializes the appropriate vector database object and configures it accordingly.

4. **Retriever Initialization:** The function uses the `auto_retriever` function from the `beyondllm.retrieve` module to initialize the retriever based on the provided data and vector database.

5. **File Saving:** The uploaded file is saved to a specified directory for further processing.

6. **Data Processing:** The uploaded file is processed using the `source.fit` function from the `beyondllm.source` module to prepare it for vectorization.

Overall, `ingest.py` provides the necessary functionality to prepare the uploaded file and generate the `retriever` for retrieval-based question answering in the `app.py`.

**Note:** There might be some error while retrieving the data in some cases, so try reloading the page and querying again.
